## 🧩 Adding Routes

To add new routes to the application, update the `Routes.jsx` file:

```jsx
import { useRoutes } from "react-router-dom";
import HomePage from "pages/HomePage";
import AboutPage from "pages/AboutPage";

const ProjectRoutes = () => {
  let element = useRoutes([
    { path: "/", element: <HomePage /> },
    { path: "/about", element: <AboutPage /> },
    // Add more routes as needed
  ]);

  return element;
};
```

## 🎨 Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration includes:

- Forms plugin for form styling
- Typography plugin for text styling
- Aspect ratio plugin for responsive elements
- Container queries for component-specific responsive design
- Fluid typography for responsive text
- Animation utilities

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is built with responsive design using Tailwind CSS breakpoints.


## ⚙️ Environment & Modes

This project can run in two modes:

- Connected mode (with Supabase persistence)
- Demo mode (no persistence; safe for local demos)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials to enable connected mode.

Required variables (Vite requires the `VITE_` prefix):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

If these are not set, the app runs in demo mode. Supabase initialization is gated to avoid crashes, booking/thread/message writes fall back to local ephemeral storage, and realtime is disabled.

## 📦 Deployment

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Built with [Rocket.new](https://rocket.new)
- Powered by React and Vite
- Styled with Tailwind CSS

## 🔐 Safety & Compliance Notes

- Client-side crisis detection is present in the AI chat UI. A basic `safetyService` logs safety events to the backend when configured. For production, add server-side moderation, rate limits, and audit trails.
- End-to-end encryption for chat is not implemented. Do not store PHI without adding retention policies, export/delete workflows, access logging, and encryption controls.
- A counselor portal and real-time messaging backend are not yet implemented.
